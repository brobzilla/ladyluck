This site allows you to paste the chat log from your X-Wing Vassal games in order to get some statistics about how 'lucky' you were.

<b>03/04/2020</b> - I'm RobK and I took this over from lhayhurst and have made some updates to support python3 and deployments to heroku.  I don't have a persistent DB yet so the data is temporary.
This is my fork of ladyluck <a href="https://github.com/brobzilla/ladyluck">find/fork/contribute to this site on github</a>

It originally began as an idea of previous X-Wing world champion Paul Heaver - a command line application that, when fed the cut-and-paste contents of a Vassal X-Wing game, would spit out some basic counts: total dice rolled, number of hits, number of crits, etc.  I took Paul's basic idea and implemented it as a web site.  You can <a href="https://github.com/lhayhurst/ladyluck">find/fork/contribute to this site on github</a> if you'd like to help out with its continuing development.
